🗳 dVote — A Digital Voting Platform
Empowering Secure and Transparent Elections Using Technology

📌 Introduction
In a digital era where security and accessibility are paramount, traditional voting systems often fail to meet modern expectations. Our project, dVote, provides a web-based, secure, and user-friendly digital voting platform built to ensure fair elections and robust participation.

🧠 Abstract
dVote is a full-stack digital voting system that allows users to securely register, log in, and cast their votes online. The platform includes robust authentication, vote validation, and real-time results computation. It supports role-based access where only authorized users (admins) can manage elections and view results.
